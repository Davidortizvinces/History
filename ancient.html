            <p>It’s the year 2490 B.C. Wooden boats cruise along the Nile River in Egypt as thousands of workers stack
                giant stone blocks into a pyramid. This 200-foot-tall structure honors a pharaoh named Menkaure. This
                pharaoh’s father, Khafre, ordered construction of a 450-foot-high pyramid nearby, and his grandfather
                Khufu built the Great Pyramid at Giza—the largest of the three—at about 480 feet. Covered in polished
                white limestone, the pyramids seem to glow in the sunlight.</p>
            <p>The Egyptians working on the pyramids are helping create a culture that will last more than 3,000
                years—it will be one of the longest-lasting civilizations in the world. During that time, ancient
                Egyptians created works of art and engineering that still amaze us today.</p>
            <h2>History of ancient Egypt</h2>
            <p>People settled in Egypt as early as 6000 B.C. Over time, small villages joined together to become states
                until two kingdoms emerged: Lower Egypt, which covers the Nile River Delta up to the Mediterranean Sea
                in the north, and Upper Egypt, which covers the Nile Valley in the south. (The Nile River flows from
                south to north, so for the ancient Egyptians, the southern part of the country was "up.")</p>
            <p>Around 3100 B.C., a king (later called a pharaoh) united these two lands to be one country, and so
                historians begin the long history of ancient Egypt here, dividing it into different periods. (They don’t
                always know the exact date of historical events. So that’s why you’ll see a "ca" next to some of the
                years. It stands for "circa" meaning "around.")</p>
            <p>Early Dynastic Period, about 525 years (ca 3100 B.C. to ca 2575 B.C.): These early pharaohs worked to
                keep the two lands under their control. To do this, they claimed they were being watched over by the
                falcon god Horus, and so the people of Egypt should respect them. They also used record keeping in the
                form of hieroglyphic writing to record things like royal decrees and the taxes that the people paid in
                the form of grain. (A dynasty is a series of rulers from the same family.)</p>
            <p>Old Kingdom, about 425 years (ca 2575 B.C. to ca 2150 B.C.): By this time, the pharaohs had enough power
                and wealth to build pyramids in their honor; that’s why the Old Kingdom is sometimes called the “Age of
                the Pyramids.” The pharaohs at this time were mostly associated with the sun god Ra, a tradition that
                would remain for much of Egypt’s history.</p>
            <p>First Intermediate Period, about 200 years (ca 2130 B.C. to ca 1938 B.C.): These pharaohs lost power
                after drought hit Egypt. Instead, local leaders took control of their own communities, and they stopped
                passing along grain to the central government. Eventually, these local rulers formed independent states.
            </p>
            <p>Middle Kingdom, about 300 years (ca 1938 B.C. to ca 1630 B.C.): Around 1938 B.C., Mentuhotep II reunited
                the country and began an era known for producing some of Egypt’s greatest pieces of art. For the first
                time, Egyptians wrote stories for entertainment, and pharaohs started construction of Karnak Temple in
                the modern-day city of Luxor.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Second Intermediate Period, about 90 years (ca 1630 B.C. to ca 1540 B.C.): Weak pharaohs again lost
                control. Invaders from western Asia called Hyksos ruled in the north; people from Kush, a kingdom south
                of Egypt, took control in Upper Egypt.</p>
            <p>New Kingdom, about 465 years (ca 1540 B.C. to 1075 B.C.): Egyptians took back control and crowned some of
                Egypt’s most well-known rulers: The female pharaoh Hatshepsut ruled for 21 years; Akhenaten tried to
                start a new religion, and his son, the boy king Tutankhamun, reigned for 10 years. Ramses II built more
                monuments to himself than any other pharaoh. This was ancient Egypt's most prosperous and powerful
                period.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Third Intermediate Period, about 420 years (ca 1075 B.C. to ca 656 B.C.): This was a time of drought,
                famine, and foreign invasions. But some pharaohs thrived. Although King Taharqa was a foreign ruler from
                Kush, a kingdom south of Egypt, he repaired crumbling temples and even began building pyramids again for
                the first time in about 800 years.</p>
            <p>Late Period, about 300 years (ca 656 B.C. to 332 B.C.): This period marks the last time that ancient
                Egypt was ruled by native Egyptians. Leading an army from Persia (what is now Iran), King Darius I took
                control.</p>
            <p>Macedonian and Ptolemaic Egypt, about 300 years (332 B.C. to 30 B.C.): In 332 B.C., Alexander the Great
                conquered the ruling Persians, then gave control to the Greek general Ptolemy I Soter. From then on,
                Egypt was ruled by Greek pharaohs. The last one, Cleopatra VII, lost a war to the Roman ruler Octavian.
                Egypt would be under Roman rule for the next 600 years.</p>
